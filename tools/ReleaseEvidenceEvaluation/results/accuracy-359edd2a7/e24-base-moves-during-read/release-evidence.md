Limitations:

- Human release decision required; this pack does not prove compliance or authorize a release.

- No repository code, PR body, diff, private file content, artifact payload or access token is included.

- GitHub rules are not fully reimplemented: deployment, merge-queue, legacy-status provider identity, signatures, bypass permissions and custom rules require separate review.

- API sources are collected sequentially; facts may change during collection or immediately afterward. A matching head does not prove freshness.

- No authenticated caller identity or host audit ID is established by this brick; the host may correlate its audit separately.
